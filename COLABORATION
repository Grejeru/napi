bashnapi is an open project I accept pull requests gladly. Please feel free to contact me if you would like to collaborate or post a patch for this project.

Rules of thumb:
===============

- always fork the dev branch (your changes before merged to master will be merged there). dev represents current development state of the project and contains the newest code.
- before posting a patch TEST it. Perform some manual verification first and use bashnapi test environment to verify if your delivery didn't brake anything else.
- write tests for your code (refer to test suite readme under tests/ subdirectory for more details)
