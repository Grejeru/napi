napiprojekt.pl client
=====================

This script is a napiprojekt.pl client written in bash. It automatically downloads subtitles from napiprojekt.pl database basing on the video file.

Usage example:
==============

napi.sh video_file.avi
- download subtitiles for video_file.avi

napi.sh *
- iterate through all elements in current directory and try to download subtitles for them. If directory contains subdirectories - than the script will also iterate through all the files in subdirectories.

napi.sh movie_dir/
- try to find and download subtitles for all files in movie_dir/ directory.

napi.sh dir*
- try to download subtitles for all files inside directories which match to pattern dir*. So i.e. if you have those dirs on disk

dir1/
dir2/
dir3/

... and you'll call napi.sh dir* - it will go through all of them and try to download subtitles for all files inside of them.
